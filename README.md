This repository serves to execute a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) deep learning model of experimentally-generated kymographs in order to analyze protein movement of PlzC in Vibrio cholerae samples. 

## TODO:
 - need to implement a custom dataloader class for our data... waiting until we see the shape of the experimental data.
